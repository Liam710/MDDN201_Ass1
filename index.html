				<h3>Router</h3>
				<p>A Router is a type of device that directs and forwards where the packets sent by your computer are going.</p>

				<h3>Modem</h3>
				<p>Modems are another device you will most likely find in any home, school or office network. They convert the data being recived through a router into something that can be transmitted (usually via WiFi or ethernet), and then recieved by the device in question with whatever connection it is using.</p>

				<h3>WiFi</h3>
				<p>WiFi is a set of protocols that enable wireless networking. They have a short range, and slower speed than wired connections, but the trade off is the convenience of wireless networking.</p>

			<div class="g-70 padded">
				<h3>Ethernet</h3>
				<p>Ethernet is another set of protocols and technologies typically used for LAN (Local Area Network) with high data transfer rates. It is much more reliable than a wireless network, so if possible you would take an ethernet connection over a wifi one.</p>

				<h3>Electricity and Phone lines</h3>
				<p>Some areas have above ground networks of electricity and phone wires which deliver power to businesses and homes all around the city. Phone lines are also strung from these poles sometimes. If there aren't any of these near you, it is likely that they are undeground in your area</p>

				<h3>Public Transport</h3>
				<p>People may not typically think of transport when they hear 'network', but by definition, it is a network. Wellington has a decent bus and train system that spans all across the region, which thousands rely upon to get around.</p>
